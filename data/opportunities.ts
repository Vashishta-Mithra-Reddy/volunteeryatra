Our farm in Coorg is more than just a place to grow food—it's a sanctuary for those seeking peace, purpose, and a deeper connection with nature.\n\nI believe in the power of community and hands-on learning. Hosting volunteers has been a fulfilling journey, allowing me to share my passion while learning from people across the world. This place is my home, and I welcome you to become a part of its ongoing story."

        about: "Hey, I’m Anjali! I used to travel all over the country with a backpack, a guitar, and an open heart. Those journeys inspired me to create a space where people could feel at home no matter where they came from. That’s how our beach hostel in Gokarna came to be—an oceanfront home filled with music, stories, and strangers who turn into friends. \n\n I love connecting with like-minded wanderers, hosting jam sessions under the stars, and curating a laid-back yet meaningful experience for guests and volunteers. If you're looking to contribute, create memories, and embrace a carefree coastal lifestyle, you're in the right place. Let's share stories, sunsets, and a slice of the good life together."
